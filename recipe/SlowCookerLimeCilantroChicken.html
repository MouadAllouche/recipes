        <li>1/2 cup fresh lime juice (about 4 limes)</li>
        <li>1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon chili powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>1/2 cup chicken broth</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Marinade:</strong> In a small bowl, combine the lime juice, chopped cilantro, olive oil, minced garlic, ground cumin, chili powder, salt, and black pepper. Mix well to create the marinade.</li>
        <li><strong>Marinate the Chicken:</strong> Place the chicken breasts in a large resealable plastic bag or a shallow dish. Pour the marinade over the chicken, ensuring each piece is well coated. Seal the bag or cover the dish and refrigerate for at least 1 hour, or overnight for a stronger flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Set Up the Slow Cooker:</strong> Pour the chicken broth into the bottom of the slow cooker to prevent sticking and add extra moisture during cooking.</li>
        <li><strong>Add the Chicken:</strong> Remove the chicken breasts from the marinade and place them in the slow cooker. Discard any remaining marinade.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook:</strong> Cover the slow cooker and cook on low for 6-7 hours or on high for 3-4 hours, until the chicken is cooked through and tender.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Once cooked, remove the chicken from the slow cooker. You can serve the chicken whole, or shred it with two forks for a different presentation. Garnish with additional fresh cilantro and lime wedges if desired.</li>
        <li><strong>Enjoy:</strong> Serve the Slow Cooker Lime Cilantro Chicken over rice, in tacos, or alongside your favorite sides.</li>
